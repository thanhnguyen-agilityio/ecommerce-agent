VI. PRODUCT PRESERVATION

Q: How should I care for different types of fabric?

- Chiffon, silk, and voile: Hand wash only.
- Coarse fabrics, tweed, and khaki without decorations: Machine washable.
- Coarse fabrics, tweed, and khaki with contrasting colors or decorations: Hand wash required.
- Jeans: Avoid machine washing to prevent color fading. If machine washing, turn inside out, fasten buttons/zippers, and wash separately from light-colored items.

Q: How can I maintain the shape of my clothing?
A:
1. Rotate usage: Wear clothes alternately to prevent losing their shape. Hang them in a ventilated area after use.
2. Avoid overloading pockets: Carry only essentials to prevent distortion of the garment's lines.
3. Use a soft brush or lint roller to clean off debris before washing.
4. Never wash suits in water or use a washing machine; take them to professional cleaners.
5. Hang garments using thick, rounded hangers or specialized ones to maintain shape.
6. Steam garments to remove wrinkles and odors while preserving fabric quality.

Q: How should I preserve the color of my clothing?
A:
- Wash immediately without soaking to avoid color bleeding. Separate fabrics by color and type.
- Use mild detergent and avoid strong bleach. For machine washing, select a gentle cycle and medium spin.
- Dry clothes in shaded, well-ventilated areas to prevent fading. Avoid direct sunlight.
- 100% cotton items should be laid flat over a drying line rather than hung to prevent fabric stress.
- Use a steam iron at an appropriate temperature for the fabric type to smooth and preserve colors.
