## Demo

Hello,
Today, I will have a demo about Ecommerce Customer Support Agent which build from LangChain ecosystem.

*Firstly, let's go to overview the app:*
-  **App**: side bar, pages, main app, quick start, conversation.

*Secondly, we will test agent ability with use cases:*
-  **Use Cases**
	-  Ask service questions
		- Give me list categories
		- How can I maintain the shape of my clothing?
	-  Search product: Give me product "Dreamy Styled Collar Shirt"
	-  Compare products
		- Compare "Straight Cut Button-down Collar Shirt" with "DIVAS Polo T-shirt"
	-  Search product not in store
		- Is there "Flowing basic shirt" in the store?
	-  Create support ticket
		- I want to create a support ticket.
	-  Ask not relevant question
		- Do you have ipPone 14 pro max?

Thirdly, we go around some other features:
- Load chat history: `52c1e9b3-b1e6-465e-b70a-3ae12ddd490e`
- Remember user basic info cross conversations
- Error handing (turn server off)

Finally, there are some techniques we apply to enhance the agent:
	- Humman in the loop (require approval)
	- Message streaming when response
	- Fine-tuning model: custom agent tone, style, format and security as well as some order to pick tools.

That's my demo about this agent.
I'm looking forward to sharing with you about it.
Thank you!
