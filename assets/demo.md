## Demo

Hello,
Today, I will have a demo about Ecommerce Customer Support Agent which build from LangChain ecosystem.

*Firstly, let's go to overview the app:*
-  **App**: side bar, pages, main app, quick start, conversation.

*Secondly, we will test agent ability with use cases:*
-  **Use Cases**
	-  Ask service questions
		- Give me list categories
		- How can I maintain the shape of my clothing?
	-  Search product:
      	-  Give me product "Velvet flared dress with puffy sleeves"
	-  Compare products
		- Compare "Tapta Fitted Dress with Collared Neck" and "Eclipse Flared Lace Dress"
	-  Search product not in store
		- Give me product "Long Sleeve Dress in brown"
	-  Create support ticket
		- I want to create a support ticket.
	-  Ask not relevant question
		- Do you have iPhone 14 pro max?

Finally, there are some techniques we apply to enhance the agent:
	- Humman in the loop (require approval)
	- Message streaming when response
	- Fine-tuning model: custom agent tone, style, format and security as well as some order to pick tools.

That's my demo about this agent.
I'm looking forward to sharing with you about it.
Thank you!
